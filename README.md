> An ngo-donations-website

### Problems Addressed:
- Countering problems faced by NGO(s) workers while searching for food , clothes or other required necessities for their organisations to be distributed among needy people.
There are a lot of food items that go waste in hotels, mess, etc. which can be reduced if it's reported to some organization which can use it to serve a better purpose and provide it to people in need. 
- To help hotel workers or anyone who wants to donate anything inform the concerned organisation that they are willing to provide the required thing.For instance people can update on the website that they have some woollen clothes(or old clothes) and are searching for ngos who can distribute them to the needy.
 
### Overview:

The site will be having two portals: 

1. One for the **people who are willing to donate**
	The people/organizations who have something like food, clothes, stationary, etc to donate they can go to this portal and post it there providing the following information:
    - The type of item they want to donate
    - The quantity of items
    - Photo of items(in case of clothes, stationary, etc.) if needed.
    - Location
    - Contact information
   -They can scroll the feeds uploaded by the NGO organisation which will inform the the person willing to donate That either the organisation is active or not.
    Or they can directly ping any relevant organisation to ask them.
    While creating a profile on the platform they can fill “yes” or “no” for if the are open from sponsoring or providing funds to any NGO event so that they can be contacted by     the organisations if required.

2. Second for the organisations such as NGO(s)
    - They can register with their location and details etc so that any person willing to donate can                   contact  them and can supply them the merchandise.
    - They can create events on the website whenever they are organising one for their ngo and it would be a good platform for them to raise funds or any goodies for their event.
    - They will need not to go to different hotels to ask if food is available so that they can donate if any hotel is willing they can directly come to know from the website and    can directly contact that hotel it will save their time and effort thereby attracting more people to volunteer for the organisation.
    - It will even provide a platform to the NGOs to collaborate together and come up with new initiatives.
    - On a single platform they will be able to share the feeds of there help to needy which will attract the people to donate to the organisation. It can be helpful to watch out the most active organisation nearby by the person willing to donate.

### Goals: 
- Our project aims at reducing the gap between the people who are willing to help and the people who are searching for such volunteers. 
- It will provide a way for the best utilisation of the resources,one thing discarded by someone can be of ultimate use to others. 
- It will help in increasing the involvement of more people in the NGOs as the task will be digitalized and so would not require much effort

### Scalability (targeted category of people that will benefit from this):
- It will benefit the NGO(s) and such organisations by making it easy to search for the available resources.
- When the work of NGOs will be made easy it will in turn benefit the people as they will get the resources which they might not be able to get due to lack of proper linking
- It will make it easy for the people who are willing to donate something because they would just have to post it on the portal without the need of going anywhere.
